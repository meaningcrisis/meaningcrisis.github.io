# Parasitic Processing

**Discussed in:** [Episode 13](/episodes/13)

"The very processes that make you adaptively intelligent also make you vulnerable to self-destructive behaviour." 

We use adaptive heuristic shortcuts to zero in to the relevant/crucial information. After a bad event, your brain immediately tries to anticipate future events like it. This can cause a downwards spiral.

Like a parasite it takes up life within you and it takes life away from you. It causes you to lose your agency and to suffer.
