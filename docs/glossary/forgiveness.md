# Forgiveness 

**Discussed in:** [Episode 16](/episodes/16)

For-giving means giving something before another person has "earned it". 

For example, by sacrificing towards growing someone into their personhood, that is already forgiveness. 

Christian forgiveness is the ability to give [agapic love](/agepe), or to help others grow into fullness and meaning, through presence and attention.

Nowadays, we tend to think of forgiveness as telling someone who feels sorry that it’s okay. However, the core idea of forgiveness doesn’t depend on your contrition.
