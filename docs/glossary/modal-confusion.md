#  Modal Confusion

**Discussed in:** [Episode 7](/episodes/7)

Modal confusion occurs when we us use the wrong existential mode for the needs they're trying to meet. In particular, modal confusion occurs when we try to address developmental needs in a [having mode](having-mode) instead of a [being mode](being-mode).

One example is when people try to meet their need to be in love by having sex. Another example is when people buy fancy cars to be more mature.

The concept was introduced by Erich Fromm.
