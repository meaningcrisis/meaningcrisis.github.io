# Procheiron 

**Discussed in:** [Episode 15](/episodes/15)

Procheiron is a stoic practice that aims to teach that "there is a difference between the existential, modal meaning of an event, and the event itself."  Meaning isnâ€™t part of the event at all. If keep them fused, you will become con-fused. If we confuse them, we start to believe that we can alter the meaning by altering the event. But this isn't always possible.

"Get a cup you really like, very familiar, then smash it. Then remember the distinction between the meaning and the thing. Practice it with little things. Then can do it with larger things."
