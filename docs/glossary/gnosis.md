# Gnosis

**Discussed in:** [Episode 17](/episodes/17), [Episode 18](/episodes/18)

Gnosis means elevated ‘participatory knowing’, rather than any kind of supernatural state. We experience gnosis when we "become one" with a higher reality.

For examples, when we hear music, we sometimes feel one with the composer of that music. 

Another example John Vervaeke describes is the feelings he had by reading Spinoza. While doing this he has moments beyond mere intellectual understanding, where he starts to ‘know’ the being and mind of Spinoza from the inside.
