# Addiction

**Discussed in:** [Episode 13](/episodes/13)

Addiction is a perspectival and particpatory learning of a loss of agency, which brings a loss of cognitive flexibility.

It is commonly assumed that addiction is a reliance on a neurochemical. However, for example, during the Vietnam war many soldiers took heroin and spontaneously stopped being addicted as soon as they arrived back in the US. Moreover, you can be addicted to processes with no biochemical basis, like gambling or computer games.
