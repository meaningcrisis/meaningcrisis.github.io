There are still many things that could be done to make Awakening from the Meaning Crisis easier accessible. The most important puzzle piece is arguably the production of high quality transcriptions of each lecture. Another important component is to add glossary entries that are currently missing. 

Everyone is free to contribute. If you're interested, send a short email to [jakob@awakeningfromthemeaningcrisis.com](mailto:jakob@awakeningfromthemeaningcrisis.com).

The table below shows the current status for all lectures and thus gives an overview of what still needs to be done.
