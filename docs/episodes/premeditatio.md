# Premeditatio 

**Discussed in:** [Episode 15](/episodes/15)

Premeditatio is a stoic practice that aims to teach that "there is a difference between the existential, modal meaning of an event, and the event itself." 

"When kissing your child tonight. Tell yourself, I may lose him to death tonight."
