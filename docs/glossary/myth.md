# Myth

**Discussed in:** [Episode 3](/episodes/3), [Episode 18](/episodes/18)

Myths are symbolic stories about perennial patterns. They represent attempts to take intuitive, implicitly learned patterns and put them into some form that is shareable with ourselves and others. 

A myth keeps pointing us to patterns that are pervasive and profound and powerful, and we can’t quite articulate them and we can’t quite know them, but the myth at least gives us at least a narrative and symbolic recognition.

One example is Plato's cave story that we still find interesting as demonstrated by the success of movies like The Matrix. 

Take note that this usage of the word myth is different from the more common meaning as being a falsehood that is widely believed.
