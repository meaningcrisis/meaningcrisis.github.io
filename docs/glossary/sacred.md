# Sacred

**Discussed in:** [Episode 5](/episodes/5)


Something is sacred if it is inexhaustible, individually and culturally. Someone who fits this definition is, for example, Plato.

>"Every year there are hundreds of books written about Plato. This is why Plato is one of the foundations, not only because of his ideas, but as weâ€™ll see there is an inexhaustibleness to Plato and his writing. We can come back to Plato! As a culture we come back at different times and see things we did not see before that are transformative and as individuals, myself personally, you can come back to Plato at different times of your life and Plato speaks to you in ways he did not speak before."
