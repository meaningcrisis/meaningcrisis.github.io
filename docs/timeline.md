In particular, “for Gnostics the important thing was not to believe in Jesus, but as much as possible to become like Jesus to go through radical transformation that allows them to be one with God.” This goal is commonly called [gnosis](/gnosis). </p>

By merging Plotinus' model with the ideas of Christianity he creates a fully integrated spiritual-scientific-therapeutic-existential framework that lasts for a thousand years.</p>

                        <p>As a result of inventions like spaces between words, reading becomes more and more a silent activity. This leads to a different model of thought that gives priority to is coherence within a language rather than participatory transformation. This leads to a rediscovery of Aristotle’s ideas and to the emergence of what we now call science. To assimilate the Christian worldview with this new way of thinking, Thomas Aquinas proposes a clear distinction between the real world, which is accessible by reason, and the supernatural world which is only accessible by faith. </p>
