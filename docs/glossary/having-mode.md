# Having Mode

**Discussed in:** [Episode 7](/episodes/7)

The having mode is the co-identification that happens when you're trying to meet your having needs. These are needs that are met by having something. I need to have water, food etc. I have to bring other things under my control in order to be able to consume them: oxygen, water, air. These needs require me to solve problems very readily.  The identities I assign to things in this mode are categorical identities, i.e. identity something has by belonging to some category. When things belong to a category, we can predict its behavior, I can control and manipulate it to solve my problems. 

The having mode is essential for meeting your homeostatic needs.

The concept was introduced by Erich Fromm.
