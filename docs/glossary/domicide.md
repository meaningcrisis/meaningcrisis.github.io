# Domicide

**Discussed in:** [Episode 14](/episodes/14)

Domicide means loss of home but not just in a literal sense but also a spiritual sense. It means a deep and profound sense of loss of home, not having a house or a dwelling, and loosing that connectedness, that rootedness to one's culture, one's place, one's history, one's language group, one's religion, one's community, et cetera.
