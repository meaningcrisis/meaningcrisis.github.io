# Being Mode

**Discussed in:** [Episode 9](/episodes/9)

The being mode is the co-identification that happens when you're trying to meet your developmental needs. These needs are not met by controlling and consuming things. They are met by becoming by coming into being.

For example: I need to become mature, I need to be in love, I need to be courageous, I need to become kinder. These needs are not met by having things but by going through transformations. 

The concept was introduced by Erich Fromm.
