# Non-Duality

**Discussed in:** [Episode 9](/episodes/9)

Non-duality is the state of optimally flowing between scaling up and down that leads to a comprehensive capacity for insight. Not insight into some specific problem but into the fundamental grammar of the [agent-arena relationship](agent-arena-relationship). Non-duality allows you to get an insight into your existential modes of being.
