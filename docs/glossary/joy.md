# Joy

**Discussed in:** [Episode 11](/episodes/11)

Joy is not the experience of fun or pleasure, joy is the positive emotion you have when you experience a deep connection to what is good. So Joy is the experience you have of this is really really good. 

We’ve lost the sense of what this word means. And we’ve lost it precisely in words like “enjoyment” where enjoyment means having fun or pleasure.
