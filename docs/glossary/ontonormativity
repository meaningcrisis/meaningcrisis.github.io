#  Ontonormativity

**Discussed in:** [Episode 10](/episodes/10)

Ontonormativity is a sense of the enhanced realness of higher states of consciousness.

Usually, we evaluate how real something is by how good it fits into the rest of our experiences. This is, for example, why we dismiss dreams as not real.

But experiences during higher states of consciousness don't fit into the rest of people's experiences but are often nevertheless considered to be more real than everything else. John Vervaeke calls this the "problem of ontonormativity"
