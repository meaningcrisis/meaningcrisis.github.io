# Participatory Knowledge

**Discussed in:** [Episode 5](/episodes/5)

Participatory knowledge (gnosis) is knowing by sharing a fundamental identity with something, a knowing by becoming, which also comes with a certain degree of imitation and internalisation. Itâ€™s the knowing you get by binding your identity to something and letting your identity being transformed in conjunction with how that thing is transforming. For example, knowing how to coordinate with your team to win the NBA Championship or how to be a parent by participating in parenthood or how you know a person you love. You don't just have beliefs about a person you love, or some particular skill that allows you to "work" with them.  You know them by how differently you know yourself and the world in knowing them.
