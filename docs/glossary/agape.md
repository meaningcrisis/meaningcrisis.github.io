# Agape

**Discussed in:** [Episode 15](/episodes/15), [Episode 16](/episodes/16)

Agape refers to the love of creation and existential transformation. Agape is the love of parent for child. You donâ€™t try and consume a child. An there is no reciprocity, no friendship. You love it because through your love you turn a non-person into a person.

Everyone depends on agape because people loved you before you were a person that you have become the person you are. Love turns non-person animals into moral agent persons. 

"It's like, if I could just care about enough about my sofa , it would turn into a Ferrari or something."
